    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
        On start, donna will load its entire configuration from one file -
        <filename>donnatella.conf</filename> - into memory. Like other
        configuration files, you can set its location via command-line option
        <systemitem>--config-dir</systemitem>
    </para>
    <para>
        The configuration is made of categories &amp; options, the laters being
        in one of the following types: boolean (true/false), integer, or string.
        In addition, some options can have an "extra" type associated to them,
        which restricts their possible values to either an element from a list
        (of strings or integers), or an integer being a combination of flags.
    </para>
    <para>
        You can define the configuration by manually editting the file using a
        simple text editor, or - when donna is running - by accessing it by
        going to <systemitem>config:/</systemitem>
    </para>

      <title>One option, multiple locations</title>
      <para>
          On many occasions, a single option can be found at multiple locations.
          For example, treeview options can be found either under
          <systemitem>treeviews/&lt;TREEVIEW-NAME&gt;</systemitem> so they're
          specific to this very treeview, or under
          <systemitem>defaults/treeviews/&lt;MODE&gt;</systemitem> for default
          options (based on the treeview's mode, as tree &amp; list are usually
          very different in their behaviors, and offer mode-specific options.
